# Unsupervised Machine Learning Algorithms

Repository dedicated to clustering and anomaly detection algorithms with notebook-based implementations and experiments.

## Overview
This project focuses on pattern discovery without labeled targets and demonstrates multiple unsupervised techniques.

## Repository Structure
- `K-means.ipynb`
- `DBSCAN.ipynb`
- `HirarchicalClustering.ipynb`
- `anomolydetection.ipynb`

## Topics Covered
- K-Means clustering
- DBSCAN clustering
- Hierarchical clustering
- Anomaly detection methods

## Learning Goals
- Understand when to use different clustering techniques
- Compare cluster behavior across algorithms
- Detect outliers in unlabeled data

## Tech Stack
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib / Seaborn

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install required dependencies.
3. Run notebooks individually to explore each algorithm.

## Next Improvements
- Add silhouette and Davies-Bouldin comparisons
- Add standardized preprocessing helper notebook
- Add synthetic dataset experiments for intuition
